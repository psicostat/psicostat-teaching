In this course, based on practical examples, we will see how to define, identify, and handle univariate and multivariate outliers as well as influential cases. On a practical level, various statistical methods will be presented using the R software. These methods can easily be extended to other statistical software as well. \n        \n        \n        \n          \n            \n              Statistics\n            \n          \n            \n              outliers\n            \n          \n            \n              influential cases\n            \n          \n            \n              R\n            \n          \n        \n        \n        \n          \n            GIANMARCO ALTOÈ\n          \n        \n      \n    \n  \n\nNo matching items"
